    This proceeding presents a novel simultaneous test 
    of muon-electron universality in the decays $B^+\to K^+l^+l^-$ 
    and $B^0\to K^{*0}l^+l^-$. The analysis is performed in two 
    distinct ranges of the invariant dileptonmass $q^2$. The 
    data used in this study is obtained from LHCb Run 1 and 2, with 
    a combined integrated luminosity of $\SI{9}{\per\femto\barn}$. 
    The results demonstrate an improvement over previous measurements 
    and show agreement with the predictions of the Standard Model.
