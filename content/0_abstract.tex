    This proceeding presents a novel simultaneous test 
    of muon-electron universality in the decays $B^+\to K^+\ell^+\ell^-$ 
    and $B^0\to K^{*0}\ell^+\ell^-$. The analysis is performed in two 
    distinct ranges of the invariant squared dilepton mass $q^2$. 
    The data utilized in this study, corresponding to a combined 
    integrated luminosity of $\SI{9}{\inversefb}$, were gathered by 
    the LHCb experiment during Run 1 and 2, spanning the years 2011 to 2018.
    The results demonstrate an improvement over previous measurements 
    and show agreement with the predictions of the Standard Model
    of particle physics.
